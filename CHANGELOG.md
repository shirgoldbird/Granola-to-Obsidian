# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.12.1] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed
- **🌐 API mode now works on machines where Obsidian's network stack is blocked**: On some machines, Obsidian's `requestUrl()` (Electron/Chromium's network stack) cannot reach `public-api.granola.ai` at all — it rejects with a bare `net::ERR_FAILED` before any HTTP response — even though `curl` and Node succeed from the same machine and network. Diagnosed live with the reporting user, with VPN, proxy, and MDM/EDR causes individually ruled out; the remaining culprit is a client-side difference in how Electron negotiates with Granola's load balancer. When `requestUrl` fails at the network level, the plugin now retries the request once through Node's `https` module (a different network stack) before giving up. The fallback is bounded by a 30-second timeout and race-guarded against double settlement, and only engages after `requestUrl` has already thrown, so machines where the existing path works are unaffected. Reported by [@andrewsong-usm](https://github.com/andrewsong-usm) in [#66](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/issues/66); fixed by [@andrewsong-tech](https://github.com/andrewsong-tech) in [#68](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/pull/68).
- **🔎 Auth failures now show Granola's actual error**: 401/403 responses from the official API carry a structured `{ code, message }` body (e.g. `MISSING_API_KEY`, `INVALID_API_KEY`) that distinguishes "no key sent" from "malformed key" from "revoked key / wrong plan". The error notice now surfaces that message instead of only the status code.

### Documentation
- The readme now documents the official API key auth mode (which shipped in 1.12.0 undocumented): setup steps, Business/Enterprise plan requirement, API-mode limitations, and a troubleshooting section for `net::ERR_FAILED`-style connectivity failures. The "Network use & background activity" section correctly lists `public-api.granola.ai` as a contacted host in API mode.

### Credits
- Thanks to [@andrewsong-tech](https://github.com/andrewsong-tech) for diagnosing the Electron-vs-Node network stack issue directly with the affected user and contributing the fallback in [#68](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/pull/68).

## [1.12.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added
- **🔑 Official Granola API support**: New "Official API key" authentication method using the official Granola API (https://docs.granola.ai). Granola 7.427+ moved its local encryption key into a Keychain item only Granola's own signed app can read, closing off the local-token path entirely ([#66](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/issues/66)). API mode restores sync for users on Granola Business/Enterprise plans, who can create an API key in Granola. Local-app auth remains the default; nothing changes for existing setups.
  - Syncs the AI summary (`summary_markdown`, used directly - no ProseMirror conversion), attendees, folder membership, calendar event data, canonical `web_url`, and (optionally) the transcript, which the API returns inline with the note detail.
  - Incremental sync: after the first full sync, only notes updated since the last sync are fetched (`updated_after`), keeping auto-sync fast despite per-note detail requests. A "Reset API sync state" button forces a full re-fetch.
  - Rate-limit aware: detail fetches are throttled to ~4 req/s (under the API's 5 req/s sustained limit) and 429 responses are retried with backoff.
  - Transcript speaker names from the API (identified names or diarization labels) are shown as-is; local-mode "Me"/"Them" labels are unchanged.

### Limitations of API mode (upstream API constraints)
- Typed "My Notes" are not exposed by the official API; only the AI summary and transcript are available. The "Include My Notes" setting has no effect in API mode.
- Notes without a generated AI summary are not returned by the API at all.
- Personal API keys see your own notes; workspace keys only see workspace-public notes. Use a personal key.
- The API has no folder-listing endpoint; folder tags and folder-based paths are built from each synced note's `folder_membership`, so the folder filter list in settings only shows folders seen in previously synced notes.

### Changed
- **🔐 API key stored in the macOS Keychain instead of plaintext data.json**: `data.json` lives inside the vault, so a plaintext key travels with vault sync and backups. On macOS the key is now written to a Keychain item (`granola-sync-plus` / `granola-api-key`) via the `security` CLI the plugin already uses, and only a flag is persisted in settings. Existing plaintext keys are migrated automatically on plugin load and scrubbed from `data.json`. If the Keychain write fails, the plugin falls back to plaintext storage rather than losing the key. Windows keeps plaintext storage (noted in the setting description).

### Fixed
- **📝 My Notes now sync for manually-created notes**: Notes created without a recording (Quick Notes, or typed-only notes) store their content in a top-level `doc.notes` field, which the extractor never inspected — the synced file ended up with an empty body. `extractPanelContent` now falls back to `doc.notes` for the `my_notes` panel type, mirroring the existing `doc.content` fallback. First spotted by [@scottxp](https://github.com/scottxp) in [#33](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/issues/33); fixed by [@anuvgupta](https://github.com/anuvgupta) ([#62](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/issues/62), [#63](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/pull/63)).

### Credits
- Thanks to [@shirgoldbird](https://github.com/shirgoldbird) for building the official-API auth mode ([#67](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/pull/67)) and verifying it end-to-end against a real Business workspace, and to [@anuvgupta](https://github.com/anuvgupta) for the My Notes fallback fix ([#63](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/pull/63)).

## [1.11.1] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed
- **🔐 macOS encrypted-credentials path now actually decrypts on Granola 7.255+**: 1.11.0 added the right code paths but two implementation details prevented them from running on real installs. The Keychain lookup was for account `Granola` but the real account is `Granola Key`, so `find-generic-password` silently returned "item not found" and the encrypted path fell back to the plain `stored-accounts.json` — itself a startup-only snapshot, hence the bug stayed hidden for the first ~6h of every Granola session. Once the Keychain lookup worked, decryption still failed because the `.enc` files are not Chromium os_crypt v10 payloads. Granola uses a two-level scheme: `storage.dek` is an os_crypt v10 envelope wrapping a base64-encoded 32-byte DEK, and the `*.json.enc` files are AES-256-GCM (`[12-byte nonce][ciphertext][16-byte tag]`, empty AAD) using that DEK. The plugin now performs both steps correctly, with strict base64-alphabet validation on the wrapped DEK. Reported in [#58](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/issues/58) and [#61](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/issues/61).

### Known issues
- **6h JWT staleness after Granola has been running a session**: `stored-accounts.json.enc` is written by Granola only at app startup, so the access token inside expires roughly 6h after the desktop app was launched. After that, the plugin's freshness check correctly identifies all file-based sources as expired and 401s on the next sync. The only continuously-fresh source is `granola.db` (SQLCipher); a reader for that is in active investigation on the `investigate/granola-db` branch and tracked in [#58](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/issues/58). **Workaround until then**: restart Granola to rewrite the encrypted snapshot with a fresh token.

### Credits
- Huge thanks to [@francescocinori-ops](https://github.com/francescocinori-ops) for the reverse-engineering (wrong Keychain account, two-level format hypothesis, GCM layout arithmetic) and to [@chuckchuck512](https://github.com/chuckchuck512) for independent corroboration plus the catch that the DEK is base64-wrapped inside the v10 envelope. This release shipped because both of you ran patches against real installs and reported back precisely.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- **🔐 401s on Granola 7.255+ where the plaintext token file is frozen**: Recent Granola desktop builds stopped refreshing `stored-accounts.json` and now write auth state only to the encrypted `stored-accounts.json.enc` (Electron safeStorage) and `granola.db` (SQLCipher). The plugin was reading the frozen plaintext file, getting an expired JWT, and 401ing on every sync. The credential loader now decodes each candidate token's `exp` claim and picks the freshest source rather than the first parseable one (Fixes [#58](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/issues/58)).

### Added
- **🔓 macOS: decrypt `stored-accounts.json.enc` via the Keychain**: On macOS, the plugin can now read Granola's encrypted auth store directly. It reads Granola's safeStorage master key from the user's Keychain (you'll see a one-time Keychain Access prompt allowing Obsidian to read the "Granola Safe Storage" item) and decrypts the Chromium os_crypt v10 payload locally. No tokens leave the machine. Linux and Windows users still rely on the plaintext fallbacks for now — open an issue if you're hitting #58-style failures on those platforms.

### Credits
- Thanks to [@francescocinori-ops](https://github.com/francescocinori-ops) for the thorough diagnosis in [#58](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/issues/58), including the JWT-exp short-circuit analysis and the Chromium os_crypt v10 format reference that made the macOS decryption path straightforward.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- **🔐 Credential loader prefers `stored-accounts.json`**: When a stale `supabase.json` was left behind by older Granola versions, the plugin was reading it first and short-circuiting with an expired token, never falling through to the new `stored-accounts.json` written by Granola 7.205+. The lookup order now tries `stored-accounts.json` first and skips paths that resolve to a directory (Fixes [#56](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/issues/56))
- **🛡️ "Skip existing notes" now actually skips**: Previously, if Granola had updated the source document, the plugin would fall through and overwrite the local file even with this setting enabled — silently destroying manual edits. The setting now truly protects existing notes; only additive frontmatter (attendee tags, attendee backlinks, Granola URL) is refreshed (Fixes [#48](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/issues/48)). **Behaviour change** for users who relied on `1.9.2`'s "Smart re-sync for updated notes"; if you want re-sync on Granola updates, disable "Skip existing notes".
- **📝 Notes without titles in Granola are no longer synced**: Granola creates the document as soon as a meeting starts, and users often add a title later. The plugin used to write these as `Untitled Granola Note.md` and never rename them. We now skip untitled documents and pick them up on the next sync once they have a title (Fixes [#53](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/issues/53))
- **📅 Daily-note links use the meeting's date, not the sync date**: A meeting that syncs the day after it took place now links into the correct day's daily/periodic note instead of being added to today's. Thanks to [@georgeguimaraes](https://github.com/georgeguimaraes) in [#44](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/pull/44)
- **📁 Nested Granola folders sync to nested vault folders**: Walks the `parent_document_list_id` chain so a sub-space syncs to `<syncDir>/Parent/Child/` instead of being flattened at the root. Thanks to [@michaeljauk](https://github.com/michaeljauk) in [#49](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/pull/49)

### Added
- **🔗 Optional attendee backlinks in frontmatter**: New toggle writes attendees as Obsidian `[[wikilinks]]` in a configurable frontmatter property (default `participants`), so attendees appear in the graph view and backlink panel. Off by default; existing attendee-tag behaviour is unchanged. Thanks to [@phenly](https://github.com/phenly) in [#51](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/pull/51)
- **⏱️ Toggle for per-speaker transcript timestamps**: New "Include transcript timestamps" setting hides the `(HH:MM:SS)` markers in transcripts for leaner notes / cleaner LLM input. On by default. Thanks to [@jsbirch](https://github.com/jsbirch) in [#50](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/pull/50)
- **🔒 README "Network use & background activity" section**: Explicit disclosure of the `setInterval` + network behaviour used by auto-sync, in line with the Obsidian community-plugin reviewer recommendation.

### Changed
- **📦 Release assets trimmed to plugin essentials**: Releases now contain only `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css`, matching the Obsidian reviewer recommendation. The release-bundled `.zip` and `versions.json` were removed (Obsidian reads `versions.json` from the repo, not from releases).
- **🔏 Release artifacts are signed with GitHub artifact attestations**: `main.js` and `styles.css` now have build provenance attestations; verify with `gh attestation verify main.js --repo dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian`.

## [1.9.4] - 2026-05-11
### Fixed
- **🔐 Auth after Granola's encrypted-storage migration**: Granola's late-April / early-May 2026 desktop builds replaced the plaintext `supabase.json` with an encrypted `supabase.json.enc` and moved auth tokens into a new plaintext `stored-accounts.json` file. The plugin now reads tokens from `stored-accounts.json` (macOS, Windows and Linux paths) and parses the new multi-account `accounts[].tokens.access_token` shape. Existing `supabase.json` / `workos_tokens` / `cognito_tokens` paths still work as higher-priority fallbacks for users on older Granola builds (Fixes [#55](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/issues/55))

### Credits

- **📝 My Notes Extraction**: Added fallback to check `doc.content` directly when "My Notes" panel is not found in the panels array, fixing "Include My Notes" not producing any content (Fixes [#33](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/issues/33))
- **🔄 Smart Re-sync for Updated Notes**: Notes that have been updated in Granola (e.g., re-enhanced with a new template) are now automatically re-synced even when "Skip Existing Notes" is enabled, by comparing `updated_at` timestamps (Fixes [#21](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian/issues/21))
